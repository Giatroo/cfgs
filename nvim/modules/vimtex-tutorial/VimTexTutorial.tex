\chapter{New vim commands}

As we have options to delete, change or yank parts of your code in Vim using
\texttt{iw}, \texttt{i"}, \texttt{i'}, \texttt{i)} and so on, vimtex offers
us new text objects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{ic} and \texttt{ac} for commands;
    \item \texttt{id} and \texttt{ad} for delimiters;
    \item \texttt{ie} and \texttt{ae} for LaTeX environments;
    \item \texttt{i\$} and \texttt{a\$} for inline math structers;
    \item \texttt{iP} and \texttt{aP} for sections;
    \item \texttt{im} and \texttt{am} for Items;
\end{itemize}

Let's show examples of how it work:

If I have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Some itens with $\frac{x}{2}$ math;
    \item Another item;
\end{itemize}

I can use \texttt{dim} to delete the what's inside the item, but keep
the little circle. If I use \texttt{dam} them I'll delete the circle as well.

I can do the same with the math mode using \texttt{di\$}.

If I want to delete all the itemize section, I can use \texttt{dae}.

And I can also delete (or yank, change...) a whole section or chapter with
\texttt{daP}

Finally, I can do the same with commands using \texttt{cic}.

\section{Surrounds}

vimtex also adds surronds, so we can delete, yank or change the surronds of
all the text objects we listed by using \texttt{s} instead of \texttt{c} or
\texttt{d}...

\section{Other mappings}

There are many useful mappings to help with faster math writting.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{tsd} toggles between e.g. \texttt{()} and
        \begin{verbatim}{\left(\right)}\end{verbatim}
\end{itemize}
